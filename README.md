# Explorations_assignment
Dividing my idea into mainly 3 branches - (The main interface, The game, The linking)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The main interface (currently named master) will include the main front end screen, the main screen with all the sketched out elements. (finalizing the aesthetics right now)
- The game (currently named flappy bird) includes the game on the main screen. (work in progress)
- The links will include all the links and the other paths. (work not started yet)
